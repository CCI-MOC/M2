# Malleable as a Service (M2)

Existing bare-metal cloud services that provide users with physical nodes have a number of serious disadvantages over their virtual alternatives, including slow provisioning times, difficulty for users to release nodes and then reuse them to handle changes in demand, and poor tolerance to failures. We introduce Malleable Metal as a Service (M2), a bare-metal cloud service that uses network-mounted boot drives to overcome these disadvantages.
